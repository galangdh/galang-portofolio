export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi! I’m a tech enthusiast and a current student at Politeknik Negeri Bali, deeply passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology.

My interests range from web development and software engineering to emerging fields like artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT). I enjoy turning ideas into real projects, whether it’s building simple applications, exploring UI/UX design, or diving into backend systems. I believe that consistent learning, curiosity, and hands-on experience are the keys to growth in this field — and I’m excited to keep pushing forward, one line of code at a time.`;
